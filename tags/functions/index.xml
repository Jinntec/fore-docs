XPath Functions As Fore uses XPath 3.1 as its expression language you also have access to the large library of functions that are defined by the standard.
XPath 3 function reference Not 100% of the XPath 3.1 functions are available in fontoXPath. There are a few that might not be (fully) implemented. In doubt please refer to their github page or test in their wonderful fontoXPath playground.</description></item></channel></rss>
