# Guides

This section gives some hints on how to approach certain aspects of developing with Fore.

"Declarative Programming" (DP) has some advantages over the traditional approaches of implementing the dynamic functionality of 
components or applications:

* in DP you describe how to do things without saying 'how'.
* DP does not hide away details of the functionality - it all there right at the surface
* it minimizes side-effects and makes the products more stable
* it abstracts operations into single tags that be relied upon to deliver the exact predictable outcome that is intended
* it frees the developer from using a complex toolchain for building, testing, bundling etc. just to make it run

However - especially for those that are used to an imperative programming style - users new to DP often wonder about the 
right approach to achieve certain things. Without knowing upfront about all the elements and how they interact, it
sometimes is hard to get started or find the best approach to your problem.

This section tries to help out with several guides that highlight specific problems.
