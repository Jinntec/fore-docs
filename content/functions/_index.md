# Functions

This chapter describes the builtin functions of Fore. As Fore uses
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/" target="_blank">XPath 3.1</a> as its expression language you also have access to a large
library of functions that are defined by the standard.  

{{% notice note %}}
Not 100% of the XPath 3.1 functions are available in fontoXPath. In doubt
please refer to their <a href="https://github.com/FontoXML/fontoxpath" target="_blank">github page</a>.
