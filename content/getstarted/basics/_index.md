Fore is a set of [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/) sharing the prefix 'fx-' that together implement
a complete engine to build highly dynamic, full-featured user interfaces without any script coding.

`<fx-fore>` is the root element containing all other elements.

```
<fx-fore>
    ... put other Fore elements or HTML here ...
</fx-fore>
```

In this tutorial we will subsequently add elements to this template 
to explore the features of Fore.
