<h2>Declarative applications in pure HTML</h2> 

Fore is a set of HTML Web Components allowing to build complete applications by writing
HTML tags.

```
<!-- somewhere in your HTML page -->
<fx-fore>
    <fx-message level="sticky" event="ready">Hello World</fx-message>
</fx-fore>
```

Just for the taste this simplistic example shows how to display a toast message once Fore has initialized and is ready.

All available components are described in detail in this documentation.
